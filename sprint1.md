Sprint 1 – GatorDash (Food Ordering Platform)
👥 Team Overview
We're a team of three working on GatorDash — two members handling backend and one focused on frontend. This first sprint was all about laying the groundwork and getting the core user management system up and running.
Backend Tech Stack:

Language: Go (Golang)
Database: PostgreSQL
API Testing: Postman


📌 User Stories
🧑‍💻 User Management

As a new user, I want to sign up so that I can create an account.
As a registered user, I want to sign in so that I can access my account securely.
As a user, I want to view my profile details.
As an admin, I want to view all registered users.
As a user, I want to update my profile information.
As a user, I want to delete my account.


🗂 Issues Planned for Sprint 1
🔹 Backend

 Setup Go project structure
 Configure PostgreSQL database connection
 Implement User model
 Implement Signup API
 Implement Signin API
 Implement Get User API
 Implement Get All Users API
 Implement Update User API
 Implement Delete User API
 Test APIs using Postman

🔹 Frontend

 Create basic UI layout
 Implement Signup page
 Implement Signin page
 Connect frontend to mocked backend (if needed)
 Basic form validation


✅ What We Got Done
Backend
We're happy to say the backend team knocked out everything planned for this sprint. Here's a breakdown of what was completed:

Project structure set up in Go
PostgreSQL database connected and configured
User model created
Full CRUD APIs implemented: Signup, Signin, Get User, Get All Users, Update User, Delete User
All endpoints tested and verified through Postman

Work split between backend members:

Member 1 handled Signup, Signin, and Get User
Member 2 handled Get All Users, Update User, and Delete User

Frontend
Our frontend member single-handedly put together the core UI for this sprint:

Basic UI structure and layout
Signup page built and functional
Signin page built and functional
Forms connected (with mocked data where the backend wasn't fully integrated yet)


❌ What We Didn't Get To (And Why)
A few things got pushed to Sprint 2 — not because we forgot about them, but because Sprint 1 was intentionally scoped around building a solid foundation first:

Full frontend-backend integration — We ran out of time to wire everything together end-to-end
JWT / Authentication middleware — Planned and prioritized for Sprint 2
Role-based access control — Coming soon
Input validation improvements — Will be refined in the next sprint

This was a conscious call. We wanted to make sure the core APIs and UI pieces were solid before layering in auth and access logic.
